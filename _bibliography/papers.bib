  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Effective Backdoor Defense by Exploiting Sensitivity of Poisoned Samples (Spotlight)},
  abstract={Poisoning-based backdoor attacks are serious threat for training deep models on data from untrustworthy sources. Given a backdoored model, we observe that the feature representations of poisoned samples with trigger are more sensitive to transformations than those of clean samples. It inspires us to design a simple sensitivity metric, called feature consistency towards transformations (FCT), to distinguish poisoned samples from clean samples in the untrustworthy training set. Moreover, we propose two effective backdoor defense methods. Built upon a sample-distinguishment module utilizing the FCT metric, the first method trains a secure model from scratch using a two-stage secure training module. And the second method removes backdoor from a backdoored model with a backdoor removal module which alternatively unlearns the distinguished poisoned samples and relearns the distinguished clean samples. Extensive results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior defense performance against eight types of backdoor attacks, to state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.},

  title={TrojDiff: Trojan Attacks on Diffusion Models with Diverse Targets},
  abstract={Diffusion models have achieved great success in a range of tasks, such as image synthesis and molecule design. As such successes hinge on large-scale training data collected from diverse sources, the trustworthiness of these collected data is hard to control or audit. In this work, we aim to explore the vulnerabilities of diffusion models under potential training data manipulations and try to answer: How hard is it to perform Trojan attacks on well-trained diffusion models? What are the adversarial targets that such Trojan attacks can achieve? To answer these questions, we propose an effective Trojan attack against diffusion models, \name, which optimizes the Trojan diffusion and generative processes during training. In particular, we design novel transitions during the Trojan diffusion process to diffuse adversarial targets into a biased Gaussian distribution and propose a new parameterization of the Trojan generative process that leads to an effective training objective for the attack. In addition, we consider three types of adversarial targets: the Trojaned diffusion models will always output instances belonging to a certain class from the in-domain distribution (In-D2D attack),  out-of-domain distribution (Out-D2D-attack), and one specific instance (D2I attack). We evaluate \name on CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets against both DDPM and DDIM diffusion models. We show that \name always achieves high attack performance under different adversarial targets using different types of triggers, while the performance in benign environments is preserved.},
