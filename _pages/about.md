Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), advised by Prof. [Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/).

Before that, I obtained my M.E. degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and B.S. degree in Mathematics from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).
I was a research intern at [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) (advised by Prof. [Baoyuan Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/baoyuanwu2015/)) and at [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu/) (advised by Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/)).

My research interests lie in trustworthy machine learning (interpretability, robustness, generalization) and trustworthy LLMs (truthfulness, reasoning).
