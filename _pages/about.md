Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a third-year graduate student (GPA: 4.0/4.0, Rank: 1) at [Division of Information Science and Technology](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculty_list/list.htm?key=), [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by Prof. [Haoqian Wang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/whq_en/main.htm).
I am also a research intern at [Secure Learning Lab](https://aisecure.github.io/), [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/) and was a research intern at [SCLBD](http://scl.sribd.cn/index.html), [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), advised by Prof. [Baoyuan Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/baoyuanwu2015/).
Before that, I obtained my B.S. degree (GPA: 4.0/4.0, Rank: 1) in Information and Computing Science from [School of Mathematics (Zhuhai)](https://mathzh.sysu.edu.cn/en), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/).

My research interest lies in trustworthy AI, especially backdoor attacks and defenses in deep learning.
My long-term goal is to make machine learning algorithms robust and interpretable.
